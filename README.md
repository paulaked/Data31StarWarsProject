# Data 31 Star Wars Project

My Plan: 

I am going to use functional programming to: 

1. get a list of the starships url. 

2. get a list of the object IDs of the pilots for each of these URLs. 

3. create a dictionary of the starship with the pilot IDs in place. 

4. Create a collection and append the dictionaries to the collection.

This will result in the code creating a new starships collection which will contain a list of pilot IDs in each starship.
