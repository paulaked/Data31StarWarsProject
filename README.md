# Data 31 Star Wars Project

## Author

Sevkan Sahingozu

## Tasks

Within this project, I was tasked to request data from the API about starships and replace the URL links within the pilots key with the 
ObjectID of the pilot that flies the starship. I was also tasked to drop unnecessary keys. Finally, I was asked to add the new data as a collection
into the MongoDB database that was pulled from https://swapi.dev/.

## Instructions

Please run the requesting_sw.py file as __main__.py doesn't work.
If you want to connect to your own database which is named something other than 'starwars' please change it in the variable
