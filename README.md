# Data 31 Star Wars Project

## Instructions

The character data in your MongoDB database has been pulled from https://swapi.dev/.
As well as 'people', the API has data on starships.
Using Python, write code to pull data on all available starships from the API.
The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship.
Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into their own collection in MongoDB.
(Make sure you drop any existing starships collections.)

You have until Monday EOD.

## How to setup and run program
- in main file check yours DB name. If you have different name than "starwars" change db_name variable to your DB name
- run main file
- if you want to print list of starships collection as an output uncomment last 4 code lines in main file
