As part of this project, I had to write a python script that downloads the data relating to 'starships' and replaces the URLs in the 'pilots' key of each 'starship' record with Object IDs from the local 'characters' MongoDB collection.

Using this script is quite straightforward. When you run it, you will be prompted to enter the name of the database in which your 'characters' collection is located. Inputs are case-sensitive.
